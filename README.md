# SafeBallot

The problem that we are addressing in our application is how people will vote during the Covid-19 crisis.  In person voting is not a viable option as it causes the concern of spreading the virus more as well as those in quarantine are unable to leave their homes.  Mail in ballots can also cause problems.  Many states require citizens to apply to get one which can be a hassle.  Security concerns are also an issue as ballots can be lost or tampered with when being sent back.  This application gives another option for those who are affected by the crisis.

SafeBallot allows its users to vote without leaving their homes.  Our system registers users similar to how they register at in person voting booths.  After they have registered the system gives them web code (username) and mails them a mail code (password).  The code has a 24 hour wait time to be mailed.  Once the user has received the mail code, they will use both the web code and mail code to login for voting.  They then will vote on a forum that is identical to the election ballot for their area.  After they have selected their candidates, they will submit the forum and they have completed voting.
