# SafeBallot

Our application addresses the problem of voter fraud through mail-in voting during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In-person voting is not a viable option for some people because they are incapable of or uncomfortable with leaving the house. Mail-in ballots can also cause problems.  Many states require citizens to go through a long process to get one, which can be a hassle.  Security concerns are also an issue as ballots can be lost or tampered with when being sent back.  This application gives another option for those who are affected by the crisis.

SafeBallot allows its users to vote without leaving their homes. Users first register to use the web voting system using their personally identifiable information (SSN, Drivers License, Voter ID, DOB).  After registration, the system gives them a unique encrypted web-code (username). The user then waits for a unique physical code (password) to arrive in the mail, which will take no more than two days.  Once the user has received the physical code through the mail, they will use both the web code and mail code to log in for voting.  They then will vote on a forum that is identical to the election ballot for their area.  After they have selected their candidates, they will submit the form, completed the voting process.
