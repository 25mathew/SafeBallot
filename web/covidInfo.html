                <h3>1 </h3>
                <p>When voting online there are a few steps that need to be taken to ensure that 
                you can vote from the comfort of your home. The first step is to register to vote online. 
                This is similar to how you register to vote in person. Information such as your social security number, 
                driver license, and birth certificate will be used during registration. Be sure to find these 
                before beginning registration. </p>
                
                <h3>2 </h3>
                <p>After registering, you will receive your username and later your password. The username will be given 
                by the site right after your registration form has been accepted. DO NOT LOSE YOUR USERNAME. This is the 
                only time that the username will appear so it can not be lost or else you can not vote online with us. </p>
                
                <h3>3 </h3>
                <p>The password will be sent to you through the Postal Service within 24 hours of registering. If the password 
                does not arrive, another one can be requested using your username and social security number. Once you have the 
                password you can now login to our voting page. Go to the voting page and sign in using the username and password.</p>
                
                <h3>4 </h3>
                <p>Once you are logged in, you may now select the candidates you would like to vote for. The options on the ballot are 
                identical to those on the physical ballot. After you have finished your ballot, submit it at the bottom of the page. 
                A confirmation will show that your vote was received. Thank you for voting!</p>
