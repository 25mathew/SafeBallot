            <article>
                <p>SafeBallot exists to help people who are unable to vote in person due to COVID-19. As election time approaches, covid cases have been increasing. Many do not feel comfortable or are unable to leave their homes during this pandemic, making it tough to find a way to vote in this upcoming election.  </p>
                <p> Mail-in ballots have been the primary option for people stuck at home, but many security issues arise.  Unfortunately, votes may be lost in the mail or tampered with as they go back to be processed. Mail-in ballots are also a hassle to obtain as many states require people to apply and have a valid reason for needing one. Voting in person is an option, but they may not be able to leave their home during voting time.</p>
                <p>SafeBallot gives another option to people who are unable to vote in person. Our website makes it possible to vote for those who cannot leave the house. We make it simpler and safer to vote from the comfort of one's home.  SafeBallot will help people now and in the future, no matter the crisis we might face.</p>
